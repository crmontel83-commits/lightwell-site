        A quick reference for how Lightwell Web Designs works with authors and creatives.

          <summary>Do you buy my domain for me?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              You’ll own your domain (for example <code>yourname.com</code>) directly. 
              I’ll help you choose a good name, buy it from a registrar, and connect it to your website. 
              The domain fee (usually around <strong>$10–$20 USD per year</strong>) is paid by you to the registrar, 
              so you always stay in full control of your author brand.

          <summary>Why do your prices look higher than some “cheap website” offers?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              Lightwell Web Designs focuses on custom, book-focused websites rather than generic templates. 
              Each project includes planning, design, build, testing, and support through launch, 
              with clear revision rounds and communication. You’re not just paying for a page — 
              you’re paying for a site that actually works for your readers and your long-term brand.

          <summary>How long does a project usually take?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>It depends on the package and how quickly content arrives. As a guide:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Starter Launch Page: around 2–3 weeks</li>
              <li>Author Website Suite: around 3–5 weeks</li>
              <li>Worldbuilding &amp; Series Hub: around 4–8 weeks</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="small-note">
              Timelines may change if content, images, or feedback are delayed.

          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              After your deposit is paid, we’ll send a simple checklist. 
              In general, we’ll need your author bio, book blurbs, any images or covers you’d like to use, 
              and links to your platforms (retailers, newsletter, socials). 
              If you don’t have everything yet, we can work around that and plan for future updates.

          <summary>How do payments work if I’m not in Zimbabwe?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              International clients pay in USD via trusted online payment providers. 
              All invoices include clear instructions and a secure payment link. 
              Local clients in Zimbabwe can discuss bank transfer or other options. 
              Specific payment details are shared in your proposal and invoice.

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What happens if I need more revisions than my package includes?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              Each package includes a set number of revision rounds so we can keep the scope clear and fair. 
              If you’d like additional rounds beyond that, we’re happy to provide them as an add-on, 
              quoted based on the amount of extra work involved.
            </p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can you update my site in the future?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              Yes. We offer simple update options such as adding a new book, changing text, 
              or creating a new section. Future updates are quoted individually so you only pay for what you need.
              During the main project you’ll have built-in revision rounds; after launch, extra changes
              are handled as follow-up work.
